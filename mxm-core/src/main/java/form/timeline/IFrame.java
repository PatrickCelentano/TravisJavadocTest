 * This is the public interface for a frame- a vertical slice of music events which occur simultaneously. Note that
 * users may not add directly to a frame, but rather, access such functionality through timeline (which themselves
 * are accessed through passages). This may seem like a lot of indirection, but it is crucially useful in preventing
 * mishaps by limiting access.</p>
