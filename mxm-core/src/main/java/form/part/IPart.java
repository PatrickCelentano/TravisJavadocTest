/**
 * <p> <b>Interface Overview:</b>
 * Parts are passages to be played by a single player- be that a pianist, a horn player, a percussionist, or vocalist.
 * What is important about a part is that the instrument never switches, and that the score to which it is attached
 * remains its "master track" for all timing information, such as time signature or tempo changes.</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>Design Details:</b>
 * This interface stands as an <b>unmodifiable but mutable</b> outer interface for a series of classes which are both
 * modifiable and mutable. This allows for MxM to control access to such classes, which are often delicate in nature
 * and should not be modified by outside parties.</p>
 *
 * @param <SoundType> The type of {@link ISound} that this part can play, whether that be pitches, chords, noises, etc.
