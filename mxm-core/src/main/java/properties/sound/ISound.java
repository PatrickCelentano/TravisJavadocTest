 * <p> <b>Interface overview:</b>
 * ISound represents any "type" of sound that can be produced. Note that pitches are "types" of sound that have definite
 * ordering and relationships (called intervals). Other sounds, however- such as a bass drum hit- may have no easily-
 * definable relationship to other sounds produced on the same instrument (such as a drum roll).</p>
