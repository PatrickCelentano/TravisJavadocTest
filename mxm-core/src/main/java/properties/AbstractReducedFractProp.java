 * <p> <b>Class overview:</b>
 * This class wraps a basic property: an fraction which must always be reduced for use in classes like
 * {@link properties.time.Beat} or  {@link properties.time.Time}.</p>
 *
 * <p> <b>Design Details:</b>
 * This abstract class represents an underlying property, and provides basic variables and methods for all derived
 * classes to utilize. Essentially, this just prevents unnecessary code duplication. </p>
